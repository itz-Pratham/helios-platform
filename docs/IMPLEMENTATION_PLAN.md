# 🚀 HELIOS - IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
## Production-First + Research-Backed Development Strategy

**Last Updated:** December 20, 2025
**Approach:** Build for Production from Day 1 with Academic Research Foundation
**Philosophy:** Every feature must be demo-worthy, production-ready, AND research-backed

**Research Foundation:**
- Based on "AI-Driven Self-Healing Cloud Systems" (Arora et al., 2024)
- Implements closed-loop automation (MAPE-K cycle)
- Uses Multi-Criteria Decision Making (TOPSIS, WSM, Entropy-weighted models)
- Industry best practices from Microsoft AIOps, Netflix Winston, Kubernetes self-healing

---

## 🎯 **Strategic Vision**

### **Why Production-First + Research-Backed?**

1. **Resume Impact** - Showcase research-backed implementation to employers
2. **Portfolio Value** - Production-grade system with academic rigor > toy projects
3. **Real Learning** - Face production challenges with proven solutions
4. **Interview Advantage** - Demonstrate understanding of distributed systems research
5. **Scalability** - Built for millions of events/sec from day 1

### **CRITICAL: Production-First Principle**

**Every phase MUST include TWO deliverables:**

1. **Backend Implementation** - Core functionality with tests
2. **Dashboard Integration** - Visual showcase in React UI

**This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.** A phase is NOT complete until both deliverables are done.

**Example:**
- ❌ Phase 2 Backend Complete + No Dashboard = NOT DONE
- ✅ Phase 2 Backend Complete + Dashboard Tab Showing Reconciliation = DONE

**Why Dashboard-First Matters:**
- **Demo-ability**: Can showcase to non-technical recruiters/interviewers
- **Portfolio Value**: Screenshots/videos for resume
- **User Validation**: Forces you to think about UX, not just algorithms
- **Interview Advantage**: "Let me show you..." (open live dashboard) vs "Let me explain..."

**Note on Phase 6 (Observability):**
- Phase 6 is about **Grafana/Prometheus monitoring dashboards** (metrics, alerts, infrastructure)
- The **React demo dashboard** is built incrementally across ALL phases (1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- These are TWO DIFFERENT dashboards serving different purposes

### **Dual-Mode Design**

Every component supports **TWO modes**:

```python
# Demo Mode (No infrastructure required)
- In-memory event index (SQLite fallback)
- Mock Bloom filters (in-memory)
- Simulated traffic with anomalies
- Local dashboard
- Statistical anomaly detection

# Production Mode (Real infrastructure)
- Redis event index + distributed locks
- Redis Bloom filters with DUMP/RESTORE
- Real Kafka Streams processing
- Real AWS/GCP/Azure integration
- LSTM-based anomaly detection (Kaggle TPU trained)
```

**Environment-based switching:**
```bash
# .env
DEPLOYMENT_MODE=production  # or "demo"
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379  # If set, use Redis; else fallback
KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=...  # If set, use Kafka; else in-memory queue
```

---

## 📋 **Revised 7-Phase Plan**

**Timeline:** Weeks 6-8 (15-20 days)
**Backend Completion:** December 20, 2025
**Dashboard Completion:** January 2, 2026
**Goal:** Build research-backed, production-ready reconciliation with O(1) lookups + Visual Dashboard

### **Phase 2 Deliverables Checklist:**

**See:** [docs/phases/PHASE2_COMPLETE.md](phases/PHASE2_COMPLETE.md) for backend completion report

---

### **Phase 2: What We Can Showcase in Dashboard (WITHOUT Self-Healing)**

**Important Note:** Phase 2 focuses on **DETECTION and ANALYSIS**, NOT execution. Self-healing execution happens in Phase 3.

**We CAN showcase:**
1. **Anomaly Detection Alerts** - Show LSTM/EWMA detecting anomalies in real-time
2. **Scheduled Jobs Status** - Display 7 running reconciliation jobs with next run times
3. **Missing Event Detection** - Timeline showing events missing from AWS/GCP/Azure
4. **Recovery Action Recommendations** - MCDM engine suggests actions (not executes)
5. **Reconciliation Metrics** - Event index stats, Bloom filter usage, shard distribution
6. **Decision Rationale** - Show WHY MCDM chose a particular recovery strategy

**We CANNOT showcase (Phase 3):**
- ❌ Actual execution of recovery actions
- ❌ DLQ replay in action
- ❌ Auto-scaling consumers
- ❌ Circuit breaker state changes

**The Dashboard Will Show:**
- "System detected 3 missing events from AWS (last 5 min)" ← DETECTION
- "Recommended Action: Replay from DLQ (TOPSIS score: 0.87)" ← RECOMMENDATION
- "Status: Awaiting Phase 3 execution engine" ← TRANSPARENCY

### **Research Foundation:**
Based on "AI-Driven Self-Healing Cloud Systems" research paper:
- Event-driven automation (StackStorm-inspired)
- Multi-Criteria Decision Making (TOPSIS, WSM)
- Closed-loop automation (Monitor → Analyze → Plan → Execute → Learn)
- QoS-aware recovery action selection

### **Block 1: High-Performance Infrastructure (Days 1-7)**

#### **1.1 Event Index (Redis + SQLite Fallback)**
**Goal:** Replace O(N) DB scans with O(1) lookups

**Implementation:**
```python
# services/event_index/
├── base.py              # Abstract EventIndexBackend
├── redis_index.py       # RedisEventIndex (production)
├── sqlite_index.py      # SQLiteEventIndex (fallback with disk persistence)
└── factory.py           # Auto-detect and return appropriate backend

# Key Features:
- O(1) event lookup by event_id
- Per-source event tracking (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- TTL-based automatic cleanup (24h default)
- Disk persistence for SQLite fallback
- Thread-safe operations
```

**Data Structure:**
```redis
# Redis keys
evt:{event_id}:src → SET ["aws", "gcp", "azure"]
evt:{event_id}:meta → HASH {timestamp, payload_hash, order_id, customer_id}
evt:{event_id}:ttl → EXPIRE 86400  # 24h TTL
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ <1ms event lookup time (Redis)
- ✅ <10ms event lookup time (SQLite)
- ✅ Auto-fallback when Redis unavailable
- ✅ Persistent across restarts (SQLite)

---

#### **1.2 Bloom Filters for Missing Event Detection**
**Goal:** Space-efficient probabilistic data structure for fast missing event checks

**Implementation:**
```python
# services/bloom_index/
├── bloom_filter.py      # BloomFilterIndex with pybloom-live
├── persistence.py       # Redis DUMP/RESTORE + Pickle fallback
└── rotation.py          # Time-windowed filter rotation (hourly)

# Key Features:
- Per-source Bloom filters (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- 10M capacity, 0.1% error rate
- Time-windowed rotation (configurable TTL)
- Redis DUMP/RESTORE for persistence
- Pickle file fallback for local mode
```

**Memory Usage:**
```
10M events × 3 sources = 30M events
Space: ~36MB total (1.2 bytes per element)
False positive rate: 0.1% (1 in 1000)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ O(1) existence check (<100 microseconds)
- ✅ <50MB memory usage for 10M events
- ✅ Persists to Redis DUMP or pickle file
- ✅ Automatic hourly rotation

---

#### **1.3 Shard-Aware Reconciliation (Hybrid Config)**
**Goal:** Support distributed databases without breaking local dev

**Implementation:**
```python
# config/sharding.py
SHARD_CONFIG = {
    "mode": "hybrid",  # "single" or "distributed"
    "shards": [
        {
            "id": 0,
            "url": os.getenv("DB_SHARD_0", "postgresql://localhost/helios"),
            "hash_range": (0x0000, 0xFFFF),  # Full range for single DB
        }
        # Add more shards for production:
        # {"id": 1, "url": "postgresql://shard1/helios", "hash_range": (0x4000, 0x7FFF)}
    ]
}

# services/shard_manager.py
class ShardManager:
    def get_shard_for_event(self, event_id: str) -> int:
        """Consistent hashing: MD5(event_id) % num_shards"""
        hash_val = int(hashlib.md5(event_id.encode()).hexdigest()[:4], 16)
        for shard in SHARD_CONFIG["shards"]:
            if shard["hash_range"][0] <= hash_val <= shard["hash_range"][1]:
                return shard["id"]

    async def reconcile_distributed(self, event_ids: List[str]):
        """Query shards in parallel, aggregate results"""
        shard_groups = self._group_by_shard(event_ids)
        tasks = [self._reconcile_shard(shard_id, ids) for shard_id, ids in shard_groups.items()]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        return self._merge_results(results)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Works with single DB (local dev)
- ✅ Supports multi-shard config (production)
- ✅ Consistent hashing for event routing
- ✅ Parallel shard queries

---

#### **1.4 Stream Processor (Kafka + In-Memory Fallback)**
**Goal:** Real-time reconciliation instead of batch processing

**Implementation:**
```python
# services/reconciliation_stream/
├── stream_processor.py  # Main event stream handler
├── kafka_consumer.py    # Real Kafka consumer (if available)
├── memory_queue.py      # In-memory queue fallback
└── window_manager.py    # Time-windowed aggregation (60s)

# Key Features:
- Consumes events from Kafka topic "events.all"
- Groups events by event_id within 60s window
- Triggers reconciliation when window closes or all sources present
- Auto-detects Kafka availability and falls back to in-memory queue
```

**Reconciliation Window Logic:**
```python
class StreamProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pending_events = {}  # event_id → {sources, first_seen, payload_hash}
        self.reconciliation_window_sec = 60

    async def process_event(self, event: dict):
        event_id = event["event_id"]
        source = event["source"]

        # Add to pending window
        if event_id not in self.pending_events:
            self.pending_events[event_id] = {
                "sources": set(),
                "first_seen": time.time(),
                "payload_hash": hash(json.dumps(event["payload"]))
            }
            # Schedule window timeout
            asyncio.create_task(self._reconcile_after_window(event_id))

        self.pending_events[event_id]["sources"].add(source)

        # Immediate reconciliation if all sources present
        expected = {"aws", "gcp", "azure"}
        if self.pending_events[event_id]["sources"] == expected:
            await self._reconcile_now(event_id)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Real-time reconciliation (<100ms after event arrival)
- ✅ Works with Kafka and in-memory queue
- ✅ Handles out-of-order events
- ✅ Automatic window expiration

    2. QoS Impact - minimize
    3. Success Rate - maximize
    4. Resource Cost - minimize
    """

    async def select_best_action(
        self,

        # 4. Find ideal/anti-ideal solutions
        ideal, anti_ideal = self._find_ideal_solutions(weighted)

        # 5. Calculate distances
        dist_ideal = self._euclidean_distance(weighted, ideal)
        dist_anti = self._euclidean_distance(weighted, anti_ideal)

        # 6. Calculate TOPSIS score (0-1, higher = better)
        scores = dist_anti / (dist_ideal + dist_anti)

        # 7. Return action with highest score
        best_idx = np.argmax(scores)
        return actions[best_idx]
```

**Criteria Weights (Entropy-Based):**
```python
class EntropyWeightCalculator:
    """Calculate objective weights from historical data."""

    async def calculate_weights(self, historical_data: pd.DataFrame):
        # 1. Normalize data
        normalized = (historical_data - historical_data.min()) / (historical_data.max() - historical_data.min())

        # 2. Calculate entropy for each criterion
        m, n = normalized.shape  # m actions, n criteria
        k = 1 / np.log(m)

        entropy = -k * np.sum(
            normalized * np.log(normalized + 1e-10), axis=0
        )

        # 3. Calculate diversity (1 - entropy)
        diversity = 1 - entropy

        # 4. Calculate weights
        weights = diversity / np.sum(diversity)

        return {
            "mttr": weights[0],
            "qos_impact": weights[1],
            "success_rate": weights[2],
            "cost": weights[3]
        }
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ TOPSIS scores calculated in <10ms
- ✅ Weights adapt based on historical data
- ✅ Decision rationale stored for audit
- ✅ Supports 5+ recovery actions

        history = await db.query(RecoveryHistory).filter(
            RecoveryHistory.action_name == action_name
        ).order_by(RecoveryHistory.timestamp.desc()).limit(100).all()

        success_rate = sum(1 for h in history if h.success) / len(history)
        avg_mttr = sum(h.mttr_actual for h in history) / len(history)
        avg_qos = sum(h.qos_impact_actual for h in history) / len(history)

        await db.update(RecoveryAction).filter(
            RecoveryAction.name == action_name
        ).values(
            historical_success_rate=success_rate,
            estimated_mttr_seconds=avg_mttr,
            qos_impact_score=avg_qos
